# **Task 1: Student Score Prediction**

Objective: Predict a studentâ€™s score based on the number of study hours.

Description: This task focuses on applying simple linear regression. The goal is to explore the relationship between hours studied and scores obtained. You will:

Load and visualize the dataset.

Train a Linear Regression model.

Evaluate it using metrics like MAE, MSE, RMSE.

# **Task 2: Customer Segmentation**

Objective: Cluster customers into segments based on behavior.

Description: This task involves unsupervised learning using the K-Means algorithm. You will:

Preprocess and normalize customer features like Age, Income, and Spending Score.

Use the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Visualize customer segments using scatter plots (2D or PCA-reduced).

# **Task 4: Loan Approval Prediction**

Objective: Predict whether a loan application will be approved.

Description: This is a binary classification task. The focus is on:

Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.

Training classification models like Logistic Regression or Decision Trees.

Evaluating models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.

# **Task 7: Sales Forecasting**

Objective: Predict future sales based on historical data.

Description: This task involves time series forecasting or regression modeling. You will:

Engineer time-based features (e.g., month, holiday, store type).

Train models like Linear Regression, XGBoost, or LSTM (if deep learning is allowed).

Evaluate performance using RMSE or MAPE.

Visualize actual vs. predicted sales trends.
